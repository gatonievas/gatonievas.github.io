  <summary> Abstract </summary> 
  <br>
  <blockquote>
A new global dataset covering international transactions from 1800 to the present, WBOP harmonizes balance of payments data across time and countries, enabling long-run comparative analysis of trade, capital flows, and foreign wealth accumulation.
The database includes annual series for 57 core territories (48 main countries and 9 residual regions) covering 100% of the world population and GDP on a consistent basis througout the period 1800-2025.
The database is accompanied by a working paper and is intended as a public good for researchers, journalists, policymakers, historians and all interested citizens.
