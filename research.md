  <blockquote>
  Reports that trade in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) proves low in relation to its economic size, and the region remains less open to trade than other regions at comparable levels of development. Both backward participation in global value chains (the use of imported inputs for production for export) and forward participation (the export of inputs used in production for the importing country’s exports) remain limited due to the region’s geographical distance from global value chain (GVC) hubs, average domestic market size, and endowments of low-skilled labor and capital. These characteristics, along with LAC’s sectoral specialization in commodities and food exports, explain the low average backward GVC participation and several LAC countries’ high forward GVC participation. Deep trade agreements present an avenue to overcome geographical remoteness, expand effective market size, and increase access to imported services that could support GVC participation and upgrading in the region. They can also improve domestic institutions, further strengthening GVC participation.
