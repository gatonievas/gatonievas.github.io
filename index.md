## About me

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. I am working under the supervision of [Thomas Piketty](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}, with [Gabriel Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/){:target="_blank"} in my thesis committee. I'm also the National Accounts coordinator at the [World Inequality Lab (WIL)](https://inequalitylab.world/en/){:target="_blank"}. The Spring semester of 2025 I visited [Justin Yifu Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Yifu_Lin){:target="_blank"} at the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}. 
The 2025-2026 academic year I will be visiting [Oleg Itskhoki](https://itskhoki.com/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University.

Before joining PSE I spent 2 years as a Research Fellow at the InterAmerican Development Bank and 1 year at the World Bank, both in Washington D.C. (U.S.). I'm originally from Bahía Blanca (Argentina), where I did my BA in Universidad Nacional del Sur. I also hold a MA from Universidad de San Andrés and a MSc (Analysis and Policy in Economics) from PSE. 

My research interests lie within International Political Economy and Geoeconomics, with a particular focus on International Macroeconomics.
